  "name": "Vulcan",
  "description": "Vulcan is a red super-Earth orbiting 0.6 AU from its star, completing a full orbit in 233 Earth days. At 1.05 times the size of Earth, this planet likely has a slightly thicker atmosphere and higher gravity. Its average temperature of 323 Kelvin places it in a warm zone, potentially creating diverse climates across the surface. Vulcan may exhibit active weather systems, with the possibility of liquid water on its surface depending on atmospheric conditions. The planetâ€™s size and temperature make it a prime candidate for further exploration of its potential habitability.",
