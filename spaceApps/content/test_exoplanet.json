  "name": "My Amazing Exoplanet",
  "description": "{name} is a fascinating exoplanet located in the habitable zone of its star system, which means it could potentially support liquid water on its surface, making it a candidate for life! This planet orbits a red dwarf star about 20 light-years away from Earth. It has a mass that is about three times that of Earth, giving it a stronger gravitational pull, and a radius slightly larger than our planet. Whatâ€™s particularly interesting is that {name} orbits its star in just 37 days, much shorter than Earth's year, which means it experiences a different kind of climate and day-night.",
