  "name": "Mustafar",
  "description": "Mustafar is a red lava landscape exoplanet, orbiting 0.15 AU from its star with a year lasting 412 Earth days. The planet's scorching surface, with an average temperature of 338 Kelvin, is likely dominated by active volcanic activity and molten rock. At 0.33 times the size of Earth, Mustafar is a small but geologically dynamic world. Its close proximity to the star and intense heat suggest a hostile environment, unsuitable for most forms of life as we know them. The planet's surface may offer insights into the extreme geological processes of other rocky exoplanets.",
