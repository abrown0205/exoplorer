  "name": "Tatooine",
  "description": "Tatooine is a yellow super-Earth orbiting its star at a distance of 0.25 AU, completing an orbit in 304 Earth days. At 0.8 times the size of Earth and an average temperature of 305 Kelvin, this planet likely experiences warm, stable conditions. Its proximity to the star gives it a unique climate with potentially extreme weather patterns. Tatooine may possess a rocky surface, though its smaller size suggests it could have a dense composition. The planetâ€™s conditions make it a candidate for atmospheric analysis and potential habitability studies.",
