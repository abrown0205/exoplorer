  "name": "Arrakis",
  "description": "Arrakis is a yellow super-Earth orbiting at a distance of 1 AU from its star, completing an orbit in 365 Earth days. At 1.1 times the size of Earth, this planet likely has a higher gravity and a thick atmosphere, possibly contributing to a greenhouse effect. With an average temperature of 343 Kelvin, Arrakis sits in a warm zone, potentially featuring vast deserts or tropical-like environments. Its Earth-like orbit suggests relatively stable seasons, though the higher temperature could mean more extreme weather patterns. The planetâ€™s size and temperature make it a potential candidate for studying atmospheres on warm exoplanets.",
