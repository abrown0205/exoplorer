  "description": "From space, the planet of Hoth looks like a pale blue orb due to its dense snow and ice covering. Five planets exist between Hoth and its sun, while an asteroid belt surrounds the planet with meteors occasionally striking the surface. Most of its surface is covered with glaciers and frozen ice plains. Another third of the planet is covered by oceans. The temperature, although always frigid, is known to drop to -60Â°C come nightfall.",
